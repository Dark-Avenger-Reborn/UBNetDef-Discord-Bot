essay_text = """The Oddities of Sleep, Potatoes vs. Tomatoes, and SUNY Buffalo’s UBNETDEF Lockdown Games

There’s that fleeting, weird moment between sleep and wakefulness—hypnagogia—where your brain decides to throw logic out the window and host a surrealist comedy special. It’s the place where thoughts warp, ideas collide, and suddenly you’re watching potatoes and tomatoes battle it out in a courtroom drama. Potatoes, the dependable, dirt-dwelling carb legends, argue, “We’ve saved civilizations! We’re fries! We’re vodka! Without us, you’d be nothing!” Tomatoes, with their glossy red smugness, fire back, “Oh, please. We’re pizza sauce. Salsa. Ketchup. You’re just starch in a jacket.” Bananas, naturally, show up uninvited and win the debate by being bananas.

Meanwhile, over at SUNY Buffalo, the UBNETDEF lockdown competition takes absurdity to new heights. What is UBNETDEF? That’s the best part: nobody knows. It’s like the Schrödinger’s cat of campus events. Are students racing to decode ancient memes? Competing to build the tallest ramen tower? Or maybe they’re trapped in some Kafkaesque nightmare where the only way out is to understand quantum potato mechanics. No matter what’s happening, one thing is clear: those who embrace full brain rot will thrive. This isn’t about logic—it’s about survival in the weirdest way possible.

Back in hypnagogia, the potato-tomato debate escalates into a full-on agrarian war. Potatoes enlist sweet potatoes as allies, while tomatoes bring in their cousin, the bell pepper, who nobody asked for but somehow makes everything worse. By the time you wake up, you’re left wondering if this battle is still raging in some alternate reality.

And so, as the edges of wakefulness blur into the subconscious void and the debate of potatoes versus tomatoes rages on, one thing becomes clear: the brain is a soup, and we are all just croutons floating within. Perhaps that’s the ultimate lesson of UBNETDEF. Or perhaps not. Who knows?"""
